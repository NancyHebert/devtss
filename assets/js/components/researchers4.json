                "en": "Let me start with my passion in science. Passion, sometimes people tell passion easily. Passion, in my thought, is the most critical factor in this field, SCIENCE. I remember the word written by the Stephen Jay Gould who said “the activity of science is somewhat resemble that of art”. People believe that artist like Vincent van Gogh has passion. Yes he had. But people often forget scientist like J.D. Bernal had the same passion. No he had more passion than any other artists. He dreamed about the ideal society through science. I think scientist forget the dream of Francis Bacon’s, described in his book . I have passion in science than any other scientist. And this is not just so story. When I first read the book by Richard Dawkins fifteen years ago, I felt this is the fantastic point of biology. I read hundreds of books in graduate student days and met lots of scientists, philosophers, and free thinkers, for example, Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley, Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, John Maynard Smith, George Williams, Imanishi Kinji, Edward Wilson, Jared Diamond, Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge, Steven Pinker, Daniel Dennett, David Buss, Stuart Kauffman, Brian Goodwin, Matt Ridley, Gregory Pence, Francisco Varela, Bjorn Lomborg, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, etc. But when I read William Coleman's book \"Biology in the Nineteenth Century\" a few years ago, I realized that the experimentalist who has his own philosophy is the real scientist than the ones who like saying, I mean polemics. The other book deals with the history of chemistry written by Eduard Farber \"Evolution of chemistry\" also made me decide to live in experimental philosopher. I like the words from Claude Bernard, \"The experimenter who does not know what he is looking for will not understand what he finds\". Bernard always pointed out the relationship between hand and brain. Good scientist, I think should be skillful at both kinds of work, with hand and with deep thought.&nbsp;"

He then studied Hematology at McMaster University, concentrating on the special problems of venous thrombosis (blood clots in the veins). He pioneered the concept of clinical prediction rules to assist in the diagnosis of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. For each of these diseases he embodied these prediction rules in valuable algorithms and they are now known as the “Wells Model for DVT” and the “Wells Model for PE”. They are currently used world-wide in the diagnostic process for these illnesses and are incorporated into many National and Organizational guidelines. As part of building his clinical practice, he established the Thrombosis Treatment and Assessment Unit at The Ottawa Hospital. In March 2009 Dr. Wells assumed the position of Chief/Chair of the Department of Medicine at The Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa."

                            "1": "UNLABELLED: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by the selective loss of spinal motor neurons due to the depletion of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. No therapy is currently available for SMA, which represents the leading genetic cause of death in childhood. In the present study, we report that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (Igf-1r) gene expression is enhanced in the spinal cords of SMA-like mice. The reduction of expression, either at the physiological (through physical exercise) or genetic level, resulted in the following: (1) a significant improvement in lifespan and motor behavior, (2) a significant motor neuron protection, and (3) an increase in SMN expression in spinal cord and skeletal muscles through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, we have found that reducing IGF-1R expression is sufficient to restore intracellular signaling pathway activation profile lying downstream of IGF-1R, resulting in both the powerful activation of the neuroprotective AKT/CREB pathway and the inhibition of the ERK and JAK pathways. Therefore, reducing rather than enhancing the IGF-1 pathway could constitute a useful strategy to limit neurodegeneration in SMA. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent evidence of IGF-1 axis alteration in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a very severe neurodegenerative disease affecting specifically the motor neurons, have triggered a renewed interest in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway activation as a potential therapeutic approach for motor neuron diseases. The present study challenges this point of view and brings the alternative hypothesis that reducing rather than enhancing the IGF-1 signaling pathway exerts a neuroprotective effect in SMA. Furthermore, the present data substantiate a newly emerging concept that the modulation of IGF-1 receptor expression is a key event selectively determining the activation level of intracellular pathways that lie downstream of the receptor. This aspect should be considered when designing IGF-1-based treatments for neurodegenerative diseases."

SMN is also present in granular foci along axonal projections of motoneurons, which are the predominant cell type affected in the pathology. These so-called RNA granules mediate the transport of specific mRNAs along neurites and regulate mRNA localization, stability, as well as local translation. Recent work has provided evidence suggesting that SMN may participate in the assembly of RNA granules, but beyond that, the precise nature of its role within these structures remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SMN associates with polyribosomes and can repress translation in an in vitro translation system. We further identify the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 as an mRNA that is regulated at the translational level by SMN and find that CARM1 is abnormally up-regulated in spinal cord tissue from SMA mice and in severe type I SMA patient cells. We have previously characterized a novel regulatory pathway in motoneurons involving the SMN-interacting RNA-binding protein HuD and CARM1. Thus, our results suggest the existence of a potential negative feedback loop in this pathway. Importantly, an SMA-causing mutation in the Tudor domain of SMN completely abolished translational repression, a strong indication for the functional significance of this novel SMN activity in the pathology."

It is still unclear whether activating motor units in SMA corrects the delay in the postnatal maturation of the motor unit resulting in an enhanced neuroprotection. In the present work, we demonstrate that an adequate NMDA receptor activation in a type 2 SMA mouse model significantly accelerated motor unit postnatal maturation, counteracted apoptosis in the spinal cord, and induced a marked increase of SMN expression resulting from a modification of SMN2 gene transcription pattern. These beneficial effects were dependent on the level of NMDA receptor activation since a treatment with high doses of NMDA led to an acceleration of the motor unit maturation but favored the apoptotic process and decreased SMN expression. In addition, these results suggest that the NMDA-induced acceleration of motor unit postnatal maturation occurred independently of SMN. The NMDA receptor activating treatment strongly extended the life span in two different mouse models of severe SMA. The analysis of the intracellular signaling cascade that lay downstream the activated NMDA receptor revealed an unexpected reactivation of the CaMKII/AKT/CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) pathway that induced an enhanced SMN expression. Therefore, pharmacological activation of spinal NMDA receptors could constitute a useful strategy for both increasing SMN expression and limiting motor neuron death in SMA spinal cord."

The role of this posttranslational modification in the life cycle of RNA binding proteins is not well understood. Herein, we report that Sam68, a heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology domain containing RNA binding protein, associates with and is methylated in vivo by the protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Sam68 contains asymmetrical dimethylarginines near its proline motif P3 as assessed by using a novel asymmetrical dimethylarginine-specific antibody and mass spectrometry. Deletion of the methylation sites and the use of methylase inhibitors resulted in Sam68 accumulation in the cytoplasm. Sam68 was also detected in the cytoplasm of PRMT1-deficient embryonic stem cells. Although the cellular function of Sam68 is unknown, it has been shown to export unspliced human immunodeficiency virus RNAs. Cells treated with methylase inhibitors prevented the ability of Sam68 to export unspliced human immunodeficiency virus RNAs. Other K homology domain RNA binding proteins, including SLM-1, SLM-2, QKI-5, GRP33, and heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein K were also methylated in vivo. These findings demonstrate that RNA binding proteins are in vivo substrates for PRMT1, and their methylation is essential for their proper localization and function."

Here we report that the Cajal body is a major epitope in HeLa cells for an sDMA-specific antibody and that coilin is an sDMA-containing protein as analyzed by using the sDMA-specific antibody and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. The methylation inhibitor 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine reduces the levels of coilin methylation and causes the appearance of SMN-positive gems. In cells devoid of Cajal bodies, such as primary fibroblasts, sDMA-containing proteins concentrated in speckles. Cells from a patient with spinal muscular atrophy, containing low levels of the methyl-binding protein SMN, localized sDMA-containing proteins in the nucleoplasm as a discrete granular pattern. Splicing reactions are efficiently inhibited by using the sDMA-specific antibody or by using hypomethylated nuclear extracts, showing that active spliceosomes contain sDMA polypeptides and suggesting that arginine methylation is important for efficient pre-mRNA splicing. Our findings support a model in which arginine methylation is important for the localization of coilin and SMN in Cajal bodies."

These peptide recognition modules are critical for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. We have arrayed glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, with a focus on protein interaction domains, on to nitrocellulose-coated glass slides to generate a protein-domain chip. Arrayed protein-interacting modules included WW (a domain with two conserved tryptophans), SH3 (Src homology 3), SH2, 14.3.3, FHA (forkhead-associated), PDZ (a domain originally identified in PSD-95, DLG and ZO-1 proteins), PH (pleckstrin homology) and FF (a domain with two conserved phenylalanines) domains. Here we demonstrate, using peptides, that the arrayed domains retain their binding integrity. Furthermore, we show that the protein-domain chip can 'fish' proteins out of a total cell lysate; these domain-bound proteins can then be detected on the chip with a specific antibody, thus producing an interaction map for a cellular protein of interest. Using this approach we have confirmed the domain-binding profile of the signalling molecule Sam68 (Src-associated during mitosis 68), and have identified a new binding profile for the core small nuclear ribonucleoprotein SmB'. This protein-domain chip not only identifies potential binding partners for proteins, but also promises to recognize qualitative differences in protein ligands (caused by post-translational modification), thus getting at the heart of signal transduction pathways."

The survival of motor neuron (SMN) gene codes for a protein involved in the biogenesis of certain RNPs. Here, we report that SMN is a telomerase-associated protein. Using in vitro binding assays and immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate an association between SMN and the telomerase RNP in vitro and in human cells. The specific immunopurification of SMN from human 293 cells copurified telomerase activity, suggesting that SMN associates with a subset of the functional telomerase holoenzyme. Our results also indicate that the human telomerase RNA and the human (h) TERT are not associated with Sm proteins, in contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that hTERT does not specifically colocalize with wild-type SMN in gems or Cajal bodies. However, a dominant-negative mutant of SMN (SMNDeltaN27) previously characterized to elicit the cellular reorganization of small nuclear RNPs caused the accumulation of hTERT in specific SMNDeltaN27-induced cellular bodies. Furthermore, coexpression of SMNDeltaN27 and hTERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysates decreased the efficiency of human telomerase reconstitution in vitro. Our results establish SMN as a novel telomerase-associated protein that is likely to function in human telomerase biogenesis."

This family of proteins is often referred to as the STAR (signal transduction and activators of RNA metabolism) proteins. It is not known whether Sam68 is a general nonspecific RNA-binding protein or whether it recognizes specific response elements in mRNAs with high affinity. Sam68 has been shown to bind homopolymeric RNA and a synthetic RNA sequence called G8-5 that has a core UAAA motif. Here we performed a structure function analysis of Sam68 and identified two arginine glycine (RG)-rich regions that confer nonspecific RNA binding to the Sam68 GSG domain. In addition, by using chimeric proteins between Sam68 and QKI-7, we demonstrated that one of the Sam68 RG-rich sequences of 26 amino acids was sufficient to confer homopolymeric RNA binding to the GSG domain of QKI-7, another STAR protein. Furthermore, that minimal sequence can also give QKI-7 the ability (as Sam68) to functionally substitute for HIV-1 REV to facilitate the nuclear export of RNAs. Our studies suggest that neighboring RG-rich sequences may impose nonspecific RNA binding to GSG domains. Because the Sam68 RNA binding activity is negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, our data lead us to propose that Sam68 might be a specific RNA-binding protein when tyrosine phosphorylated."

A caspase-2 minigene construct has been made that can be alternatively spliced in transfected cells and in nuclear extracts. Using this system, we have identified a 100-nt region in downstream intron 9 that inhibits the inclusion of the 61-bp alternative exon. This element (In100) can facilitate exon skipping in the context of competing 3' or 5' splice sites, but not in single-intron splicing units. The In100 element is also active in certain heterologous pre-mRNAs, although in a highly context-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that In100 contains a sequence that highly resembles a bona fide 3' splice site. We provide evidence that this sequence acts as a \"decoy\" acceptor site that engages in U2 snRNP-dependent but nonproductive splicing complexes with the 5' splice site of exon 9, hence conferring competitive advantage to the exon-skipping splicing event (E8-E10). These results reveal a mechanism of action for a negative intronic regulatory element and uncover a role for U2 snRNP in the regulation of alternative splicing."

Inclusion or skipping of a cassette-type exon in the 3' portion of this pre-mRNA leads to the production of isoforms with antagonistic activity in apoptosis. We previously identified a negative regulatory element (In100) located in the intron downstream of alternative exon 9. The upstream portion of this element harbors a decoy 3' acceptor site that engages in nonproductive commitment complex interactions with the 5' splice site of exon 9. This in turn confers a competitive advantage to the exon-skipping splicing pattern. Further characterization of the In100 element reveals a second, functionally distinct, domain located downstream from the decoy 3' acceptor site. This downstream domain harbors several polypyrimidine track-binding protein (PTB)-binding sites. We show that PTB binding to these sites correlates with the negative effect on exon 9 inclusion. Finally, we show that both domains of the In100 element can function independently to repress exon 9 inclusion, although PTB binding in the vicinity of the decoy 3' splice site can modulate its activity. Our results thus reveal a complex composite element that regulates caspase-2 exon 9 alternative splicing through a novel mechanism."

Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 is associated with either exonic or intronic mutations in the tau gene. This highlights the involvement of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the splicing defects underlying these diseases. To establish a model system for studying the role of pre-mRNA splicing in neurodegenerative diseases, we have constructed a tau minigene that reproduces tau alternative splicing in both cultured cells and in vitro biochemical assays. We demonstrate that mutations in a nonconserved intronic region of the human tau gene lead to increased splicing between exon 10 and exon 11. Systematic biochemical analyses indicate the importance of U1 snRNP and, to a lesser extent, U6 snRNP in differentially recognizing wild-type versus intron mutant tau pre-mRNAs. Gel mobility shift assays with purified U1 snRNP and oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage experiments support the idea that the intronic mutations destabilize a stem-loop structure that sequesters the 5' splice site downstream of exon 10 in tau pre-mRNA, leading to increases in U1 snRNP binding and in splicing between exon 10 and exon 11. Thus, mutations in nonconserved intronic regions that increase rather than decrease alternative splicing can be an important pathogenic mechanism for the development of human diseases."

We have set up an in vitro splicing system that mimics the neuro-specific alternative splicing profile of NCAM exon 18. Splicing regulation is observed using model pre-mRNAs that contain competing 5' or 3' splice sites, suggesting that distinct pathways regulate NCAM 5' and 3' splice site selection. While inclusion of exon 18 is the predom-inant choice in neuronal cells, an element in the 5' common exon 17 improves exon 17/exon 19 splicing in a neuronal cell line. A similar behavior is observed in vitro as the element can stimulate the 5' splice site of exon 17 or a heterologous 5' splice site. The minimal 32 nt sequence of the exon 17 enhancer consists of purine stretches and A/C motifs. Mutations in the purine stretches compromise the binding of SR proteins and decreases splicing stimulation in vitro. Mutations in the A/C motifs do not affect SR protein binding but reduce enhancing activity. Our results suggest that the assembly of an enhancer complex containing SR proteins in a 5' common exon ensures that NCAM mRNAs lacking exon 18 are made in neuronal cells."

To further study the contribution of 5' splice site sequences, we used a simple NCAM pre-mRNA containing a portion of E18 fused to E19 and separated by a shortened intron. This RNA is spliced in vitro to produce five sets of lariat intermediates and products, the most abundant set displaying aberrant migration in acrylamide/urea gels. Base pairing interactions between positions +5 and +8 of the intron and positions -3 and -6 from the branch point were responsible for the faster migration of this set of lariat molecules. To test whether the duplex structure forms earlier and contributes to 5' splice site selection, we used NCAM substrates carrying the 5' splice sites of E17 and E18 in competition for the 3' splice site of E19. Mutations upstream of the major branch site improve E18/E19 splicing in NIH3T3 extracts, whereas compensatory mutations at positions +7 and +8 neutralize the effect of branch site mutations and curtail E18/E19 splicing. Our data suggest that duplex formation occurs early and interferes with the assembly of complexes initiated on the 5' splice site of NCAM E18. This novel type of intron interaction may exist in the introns of other mammalian pre-mRNAs."

To understand how the 5' splice site of exon 18 contributes to splicing regulation, we have investigated the interaction of the U2AF65 splicing factor to pre-mRNAs that contained portions of the constitutive exon 17 or the alternate exon 18 fused to exon 19 and separated by a shortened intron. Despite sharing an identical 3' splice site, only the pre-mRNA that contained a portion of exon 17 and its associated 5' splice site displayed efficient U2AF65 cross-linking. Strikingly, a G-->U mutation at position +6 of the intron, converting the 5' splice site of exon 18 into that of exon 17, stimulated U2AF65 crosslinking. The improved cross-linking efficiency of U2AF65 to a pre-mRNA carrying the 5' splice site of exon 17 required the integrity of the 5' end of U1 but not of U2 small nuclear RNA. Our results indicate that neural cell adhesion molecule 5' splice site sequences influence U2AF65 binding through a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein/U2AF interaction that occurs at the commitment stage of spliceosome assembly, before stable binding of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Thus, the 5' splice sites of exons 17 and 18 differentially affect U2AF65 binding to the 3' splice site of exon 19. Factors that modulate U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein binding to these 5' splice sites may play a critical role in regulating exon 18 skipping."

This target is based on limited evidence, and we sought to determine the optimal compression depth range. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied emergency medical services-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed Analysis clinical trial and the Epistry-Cardiac Arrest database. We calculated adjusted odds ratios for survival to hospital discharge, 1-day survival, and any return of circulation. We included 9136 adult patients from 9 US and Canadian cities with a mean age of 67.5 years, mean compression depth of 41.9 mm, and a return of circulation of 31.3%, 1-day survival of 22.8%, and survival to hospital discharge of 7.3%. For survival to discharge, the adjusted odds ratios were 1.04 (95% CI, 1.00-1.08) for each 5-mm increment in c"

METHODS: We conducted this prospective cohort study in 6 large Canadian academic emergency departments. Patients were assessed for standardized clinical variables and then followed for serious adverse events, defined as death, intubation, admission to a monitored unit or new visit to the emergency department requiring admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 945 patients, of whom 354 (37.5%) were admitted to hospital. Of 74 (7.8%) patients with a subsequent serious adverse event, 36 (49%) had not been admitted after the initial emergency visit. Multivariable modelling identified 5 variables that were independently associated with adverse events: prior intubation, initial heart rate ≥ 110/minute, being too ill to do a walk test, "

A careful evaluation of the patient's history should be performed to determine the time of onset of the arrhythmia. All patients should be stratified using a predictive index for the risk of stroke (eg, CHADS(2)). For stable patients with recent-onset AF/AFL, a strategy of either rate control or rhythm control could be selected based on multiple factors including the duration of AF and the severity of symptoms.

METHODS: We conducted this three-year prospective cohort study in six Canadian emergency departments. The study involved adult trauma patients who were alert and whose condition was stable. We provided two hours of training to 191 triage nurses. The nurses then assessed patients using the Canadian C-Spine Rule, including determination of neck tenderness and range of motion, reapplied immobilization and completed a data form.

Results of a previous study suggest better outcomes for patients treated with vasopressin than for those given epinephrine, in the out-of-hospital setting.

METHODS: We did a triple-blind randomised trial in the emergency departments, critical care units, and wards of three Canadian teaching hospitals. We assigned adults who had cardiac arrest and required drug therapy to receive one dose of vasopressin 40 U or epinephrine 1 mg intravenously, as the initial vasopressor. Patients who failed to respond to the study intervention were given epinephrine as a rescue medication. The primary outcomes were survival to hospital discharge, survival to 1 h, and neurological function. Preplanned subgroup assessments included patients with myocardial ischaemia or infarction, initial cardiac rhythm, and age. FINDINGS: "

Such studies have called into question the traditional dose of epinephrine (0.007 to 0.014 mg per kilogram) recommended for advanced cardiac life support. METHODS: We randomly assigned 650 patients who had had cardiac arrest either in or outside the hospital to receive up to five doses of high-dose (7 mg) or standard-dose (1 mg) epinephrine at five-minute intervals according to standard protocols for advanced cardiac life support. Patients who collapsed outside the hospital received no advanced-life-support measures other than defibrillation before reaching the hospital. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the high-dose group (n = 317) and the standard-dose group (n = 333) in the proportions of patients who survived for one hour (18 percent vs. 23 percent, respectively) or who survived until hospital "
